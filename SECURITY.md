\## Security Scope

This project focuses on \*software-level\* secure deletion of specified files and folders.  

It \*\*does not\*\* claim full physical sanitization of storage media (especially SSDs or cloud drives).



\## Known Limitations

\- SSD wear-leveling and copy-on-write filesystems may retain previous data blocks.

\- Use hardware or firmware-level erasure for full sanitization.



\## Verification

Users are encouraged to inspect, audit, and rebuild the source before deployment.
